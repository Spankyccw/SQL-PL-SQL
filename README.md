# SQL-PL-SQL
Oracle SQL &amp; PL/SQL historical scripts
These scripts are old and therefore need to checked against your version of Oracle.
GitHub was a convenient place to store and highlight these old scripts I created or collected in the past for historical reference and potential reuse.
Use at your own risk.
